## Project Details
This portfolio is a static website hosted on GitHub Pages. The source code is available in this repository, written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Dynamic features (e.g., skills display) are implemented with JavaScript, with plans to refactor into a React application.

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/SaifurRahmanRatul/Portfolio.git`
2. Navigate to the folder: `cd Portfolio`
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser or use a local server (e.g., Live Server in VS Code) for full functionality.
4. Ensure `style.css` and `script.js` are in the same directory as `index.html`.

## Future Plans
- Enhance the website with JavaScript for dynamic features like form validation and smooth scrolling.
- Refactor the project into a React application to leverage component-based development.
- Deploy additional projects showcasing my growing skill set.
